# Assignment 7

You will be using functions and fields from the `Math` class in order to generate points from a trigonometric function. Please refer to your notes and the offical [Java docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html).

## Specifications

1. Take input from the user for the angle in degrees. 
2. Convert from degrees to radians.
3. Evaluate for the function value.
4. Print the point.

Please use the following function:

Note: you must use the field for pi and functions for sine and exponents.

### Sample Outputs

```
Enter an x value (degrees): 0
The point is: (0.0, 2.5000000000000004)
```

```
Enter an x value (degrees): 120
The point is: (2.0943951023931953, 1.2009618943233422)
```

```
Enter an x value (degrees): -315
The point is: (-5.497787143782138, 4.0)
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style (variable naming, spacing, indentation, etc.).
